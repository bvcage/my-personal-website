    <p>Hello, world!</p>
    <p>
        Ten years ago, I switched out of a software engineering major. 
        All engineering school students had to take an introductory course, but it could be for any discipline.  
        The computer science course filled up, so I decided on an electrical engineering course: It seemed similar enough.  
        I realized from that course that EE was not for me, but I mistakenly let that realization cloud my judgment about pursuing software engineering.  
        I wish I could tell my teenage self to stick with the major.

        I ultimately earned an economics degree, but I was able to secure a role at a software company after college.  
        I was a technical analyst that existed somewhere between the customer IT team and the software developers themselves.  
        They taught us to code in a two-week intensive and six-month follow-on curriculum.  
        I found so much joy tracing through code to explain to my customer why their system was behaving unexpectedly.  
        I jumped at the chance to code a small feature myself when my customer needed something custom.  
        I truly loved that job.
    </p>

        Five years ago, however, I left that job to go to law school.  
        Because I had graduated in December, I applied to law schools at the same time I applied to the software company.  
        I deferred my admission for a year, but I felt I had to go.  
        Ultimately, I learned a lot, and I cannot bring myself to regret the decision, but I do feel like I gave up on a true passion.

        This year, I found myself at a crossroads.  
        I had decided to leave my job, and I was deciding between lateraling to a similar job or leaving law altogether.  
        I decided to enroll in a software engineering immersive because I think I will be happiest pursuing a career change.  
        I fear the uncertainty, but I am incredibly excited to start down a path that I had, somewhat inexplicably, chosen to forgo ten years ago.
